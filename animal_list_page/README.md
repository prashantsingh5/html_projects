# Animal-List-Page
It is a demo project, In which i store the details and list of some animals to demonstrate ordered-list, unorderd-list, table, section, article and other vaious important topics to expand my basic understanding about HTML.
In this project, I stored the the names, images, basic description about animal and fun facts of animal.
List of animal started with "A", "B", "C", "D" and more.
Then, I applied some basic CSS concepts to make our project pretty and good.
