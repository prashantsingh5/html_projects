        <p>There are few of these species of leopards left, so they are pretty hard to find. But if you do find them, it’d probably be in a freezing place. These leopards love the cold.
        <br>The Amur leopard is not one of the biggest cats but is definitely one of the most beautiful. </p>
        <p><strong>Fun Fact </strong> :- The Amur leopard has tiny hooks on its tongue to help it lick the meat off bones.</p>

            Their name is from the Afrikaans language in South Africa, which means ‘earth pig.’ They really hit the mark on that name, as aardvarks like to spend their days hiding from the sun underground.
        </p>

            With some individuals weighing over six tons, the African Elephant takes the position of the largest land animal on earth.

            Its large ears, unique tusks, and long trunk make the African Bush Elephant recognizable from a mile away..

            </p>

            The hair of Angora goats makes them one of the most sought-after species of goats. Their hair is called Mohair, and it’s softer and has a better sheen than normal Angora fur. A great read from Animals that start with A.

About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.
